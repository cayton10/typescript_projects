# typescript_projects

Codecademy typescript projects and anything else TS that I decide to throw in here.

# To Run:

Ensure you have Typescript installed by executing terminal command ```tsc -v```. If the command is not recognized, you
need to install. Check [this link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) for instructions.

The compiled Javascript has been ignored for all projects. To run these simple programs, navigate to the desired 
project directory and execute ```tsc``` to compile the .js executable, followed by ```node index.js```.

## Pixel Smile
This was essentially just a debugging exercise. Use ```tsc``` command and observe the output. Squash the bugs.
The file that is provided from Codecademy's "project" for this is just full of bugs and need corrected.
